# Sensei-AI
Sensei-AI is a project that allows users to get the content according to their learning style. We train and test machine learning models using a variety of algorithms and datasets. The project is designed to be user-friendly, flexible, and customizable, making it suitable for both beginners and advanced users.

Different type of learner

i) Visual Learning 

The students who are visual or spatial learners might draw, make lists or take notes in order to interact with and process information.

ii) Auditory Learning 

These are students who prefer listening to a lecture or a recording rather than taking written notes. 

iii) Reading/Writing Learning 

Reading/writing preference learners can be discerned as those who express themselves through writing.

iV) Kinesthetics Learning 

They like to use their hands and bodies as learning instruments, often acting out events and using their hands when they talk.
